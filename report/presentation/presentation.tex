\section{Problem Introduction}
\begin{frame}{Problem}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<+-> We are given a sentence or sentences, two candidate nouns within a sentence and a pronoun
  \item<+-> Task is to identify which of the two candidates referes to that pronoun
  \item<+-> Introduced as Kaggle competition by Google AI
  \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}<+->{Example}
      Impressed by her beauty, her warrior skills, and the fact that she was able to locate him, she is promoted to a position similar to that later held by her half-sister, Talia. As a right hand associate, she accompanies him during his adventures. Ra's is so impressed with her abilities, he even allows Nyssa to use his Lazarus Pits. Like \textit{\textbf{her}} sister \textbf{Talia}, \textbf{\underline{Nyssa}} eventually becomes disenchanted with Ra's genocidal plans to ``cleanse the Earth'', and disassociates herself from her father sometime in the early 20th century.
